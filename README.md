## Introduction

Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs of one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing coughing up phlegm or pus, fever, chills and shortness of breath. Various microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.
Signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from moderate to severe and depend on several factors, such as the type of germ that caused the infection, age and general health. Moderate signs and symptoms are often similar to those of a cold or the flu, but last longer.
Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include the following:
Chest pain when breathing or coughing.
Disorientation or changes in mental perception (in adults age 65 and older)
Cough that may produce phlegm
Fatigue
Fever, sweating, and shaking chills
Lower than normal body temperature (in adults over age 65 and people with weak immune systems)
Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea
Shortness of breath
